From an email from Josh Blum:

VITA49 has quite a lot going on, and formats for all kinds of intricate
packets for specific things like GPS data.

So, for USRPs, we use a subset of VITA49. Basically VITA IF stream
packets with stream ID fields, and time stamp fields, sometimes
trailers. Also extension context packets.

This is the parser for UHD (GPL):
https://github.com/EttusResearch/uhd/blob/master/host/include/uhd/transport/vrt_if_packet.hpp
It supports VITA IF with and without VRL encapsulation.

Eric blossom wrote a VITA parser at one point as well. I dont know where
its hosted now, but it was once in the gnuradio repo:

Here are also some blocks also with their own parser that use VRL and
VITA49 (GPL):
